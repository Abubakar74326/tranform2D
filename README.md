### General information:
In this project user give the value of length and width to take the graph image of rectangle ,radius value to take the graph image of circle and equall 
length to take graph image of square,and get triangle by 
giving request of triangle in url along coordinates in request body and get graph image in response.

 ### Technoloy:

install ```Python 3.8.10```

install ```Flask 2.0.3```
### Testing:
Created visualization is obtain by adding *rectangle* after API in URL for Rectangle ,*square* for Square ,*circle* for Circle,
