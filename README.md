### General information:
This project is divided into two parts 
first part implements the different functions to transform 2D point and return 
its new coordinates.user also take graph as a output by giving condition graph =TRUE  along with implementing function like rotate,translations,scaling,Shearing.


in second part of project user give the value of length and width o take the graph image of rectangle ,radius value 
to take the graph image of circle and  equall length and width to take graph image of square,and get triangle by giving request of triangle in url and get graph image in response.

**RUN** api.py files of **plotimage branch** and **plot3d branch**
