# Transformation of 2D coordinates and ploting
## Table of Content:

General information

Technology

### General information:
This project is divided into two parts 
first part implements the different functions to transform 2D point and return 
its new coordinates.user also take graph as a output by giving condition graph =TRUE  along with implementing function like rotate,translation,scaling,Shearing.


In second part of project user give the value of length and width o take the graph image of rectangle ,radius value 
to take the graph image of circle and  equall length and width to take graph image of square,and get triangle by giving request of triangle in url and get graph image in response.
### Get started:
 For run this project locally run the following technology.after word get API by 
 running the **api.py** files of plotimage branch and **main.py file** for plot3d branch and open it in your browser but good pratice is run in POSTMAN.

**RUN** the **api.py** files of plotimage branch and **main.py file** for plot3d branch
 #### Technoloy

install ```Python 3.8.10```

install ```Flask 2.0.3```

###Testing:
#### For Graph ploting of Geometrical shapes Project:
Created visualization is obtain by adding *rectangle* after above API in URL for Rectangle ,*square* for Square ,*circle* for Circle,
*triangle* for Triangle along with adding its parameter in its relative request body.
#### For Transformation of 2D coordinates and get graph images Projecct:
o **run** rotation function enter *rotate* in front of URL,*translation* for translation function,
*scaling* for scaling function *shering* for shering function.

### URL for published documentation:
This link give the URL of triangle ,rectangle,circle and square with complete documenation:
